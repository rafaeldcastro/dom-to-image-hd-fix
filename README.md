#  DOM to Image - HD Fix

## What is it
ORIGINAL: https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image

**dom-to-image** by tsayen is a library which can turn arbitrary DOM node into
a vector (SVG) or raster (PNG or JPEG) image, written in JavaScript. It's
based on [domvas by Paul Bakaus](https://github.com/pbakaus/domvas)
and has been completely rewritten, with some bugs fixed and some new
features (like web font and image support) added.

This HD Fix is a compilation on some issues addressed by users and reunited in here. 
The final render is doubled than original.
